In modern DL frameworks like Tensorflow and Pytorch, the backpropagation is computed automatically once the forward propagation is build. Nevertheless, it's always a good thing to understand how the gradients are "propagated" layer by layer during backpropagation.

I have taken a 2-layer NN as a simple example to show how the formula is derived.
